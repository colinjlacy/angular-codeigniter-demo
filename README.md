A demo combining AngularJS and CodeIgniter

###The Story###

This is basically a quick demo to accompany a blog post I wrote about integrating AngularJS and CodeIgniter, so that Angular runs all of the necessary front-end logic, while CodeIgniter runs some back-end stuff like validation, database communication, etc.  The goal was to set up an Angular environment that has a clean back-end with which to communicate.

Feel free to pull, fork, and edit however you like.  I have a version of this running on my server, with an explanation of how it's all set up written on my blog.

Enjoy!
